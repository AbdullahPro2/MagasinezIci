        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>
          I am a software engineering student and a web frontend developer with
          a passion for creating beautiful and functional websites that provide
          great user experiences.

          During my internship, I gained valuable experience in designing and
          implementing responsive and intuitive interfaces. I believe in the
          power of collaboration and teamwork, and I enjoy sharing my
          experiences and learning from others. In addition to my technical
          skills, I have a keen interest in human nature and enjoy studying it.
          Outside of work, I stay up-to-date with the latest industry trends and
          innovations and actively seek out new learning opportunities to
          improve my skills and knowledge.

          , <strong>Bootstrap 5</strong>, <strong>Tailwind CSS</strong>,{" "}
          <strong>JavaScript</strong>, <strong>React</strong>,{" "}

          I am adept at working with APIs to fetch and display data dynamically
          on web interfaces. Leveraging my skills in JavaScript, I effectively
          interact with APIs, retrieve data, and seamlessly integrate it into
          web applications, providing users with dynamic and interactive
          content.
